TXT files in this folder will be tried with automatic encoding detection; the result must then match their second extension (one before txt).

E.g.
  edict.euc.txt
  test.utf8.txt

Put any misidentified snippets of text here after you fix the identification routine. Add any comments at the end of the snippet.

Note that not every snippet of text HAS to be identified properly, but large clearly recognizable samples should be.
