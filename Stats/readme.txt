KanjiStats
Parses text files (books) and builds a list of used kanji by frequency. It's possible to exclude already known kanjis from the list.

Syntax:
kanjistats.exe <file1> [file2] [...] [-k known_file] [-o output_file] [-v]

If no -o is specified, outputs to console.
-v enables verbose output (kanji=occurences).
