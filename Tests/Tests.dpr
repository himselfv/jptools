  Delphi DUnit Test Project
  -------------------------
  This project contains the DUnit test framework and the GUI/Console test runners.
  Add "CONSOLE_TESTRUNNER" to the conditional defines entry in the project options
  to use the console test runner.  Otherwise the GUI test runner will be used by
  default.

  Global conditionals:
  HARDCORE
    Adds hardcore versions of some tests. Principally they're the same, but with
    more load and therefore slower.
    May help to catch errors which only occur in heavy load conditions. Set when
    running final checks before releasing.
